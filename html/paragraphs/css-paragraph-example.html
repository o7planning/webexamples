    <h3>CSS Paragraph</h3>

    <p>Separating paragraphs with blank lines is easiest
      for readers to scan, but they can also be separated
      by indenting their first lines. This is often used
      to take up less space, such as to save paper in print.</p>

      <p>Writing that is intended to be edited, such as school
      papers and rough drafts, uses both blank lines and
      indentation for separation. In finished works, combining
      both is considered redundant and amateurish.</p>

      <p>In very old writing, paragraphs were separated with a
      special character: ¶, the <i>pilcrow</i>. Nowadays, this
      is considered claustrophobic and hard to read.</p>

  <p>How hard to read? See for yourself:
    <button data-toggle-text="Oh no! Switch back!" onClick="togglePilcrow()">Use pilcrow for paragraphs</button>
  </p>
